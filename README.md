# Weather App
Basic weather application made using a tutorial, trying to gain familiarity with JS for future project usage(s) with Python/Django or other frameworks.

Likely will expand and overhaul most of this to use it as a base for future idea(s) once I've learned how to use frameworks and Js well enough to make it
